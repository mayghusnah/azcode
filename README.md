Weather Image Classification Project
Overview :
This project focuses on classifying weather images using EfficientNetB3 and DenseNet121 models. The aim is to accurately classify images into different weather categories such as  cloudy, rainy, shine, and sunrise.

Requirements :
Install Anaconda Jupyter Notebook or use Google Colab

Dataset : 
Multi-class weather dataset(MWD) for image classification is a valuable dataset used in the research paper entitled “Multi-class weather recognition from the still image using heterogeneous ensemble method”.

Class	# of Images
Sunrise	   357
Shine	     253
Rain	     215
Cloudy	   300

Models :
EfficientNet is a mobile friendly pure convolutional model (ConvNet) that proposes a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient.

DenseNet-121 is a variant of the DenseNet architecture, designed to balance model depth and computational efficiency. DenseNet-121 is characterized by its 121-layer deep network with densely connected convolutional layers.


Results:
EffcientNet -100%
Densenet121 -96.45%
